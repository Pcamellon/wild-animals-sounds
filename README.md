# wild-animals-sounds

It was developed a desktop application using Qt 4 IDE and libraries, to teach some wild animals sounds.

A program was designed that in its graphical interface allows selecting with a combobox, between different animals (minimum 6) and when selecting one, its characteristics are presented (Extracted from a database) as well as an image of it, and there must be a button that allows to reproduce the sound that said animal emits, in addition during all the execution of the program there must be an instrumental music in the background; for this it must rely on the QSound library and on one or more timers.
Note: The animals must be wild, and their main characteristics must be their habitat, kingdom to which they belong, size, weight, reproduction, risk of extinction. The user should be able to add some other feature to it if they have administrator privileges.
